\subsection*{5.13} A \emph{\textbf{useless state}} in a Turing machine is one that is never entered on any input string. Consider the problem of determining whether a Turing machine has any useless states. Formulate this problem as a language and show that it is undecidable.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Let $USELESS_{TM}$ = \{\angles{M, q} $|$ $q$ is a useless state in $M$\}. Suppose that $USELESS_{TM}$ was decidable, and let $U$ be its decider. We will construct a decider $E$ for $E_{TM}$:
\\
$E$ = ``On input \angles{M} where $M$ is a TM:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
\item[1.]Run $U$ on \angles{M, q_{accept}}, where $q_{accept}$ is $M$'s accept state.
\item[2.]Output what $U$ outputs.
\end{enumerate}
Since $E_{TM}$ is undecidable, $USELESS_{TM}$ is also undecidable.

\subsection*{5.17} Show that the Post Correspondence Problem is decidable over the unary alphabet $\Sigma = \{1\}$.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Since $\Sigma = \{1\}$, there is only a difference in the number of 1s on the top of each domino compared to the bottom. We will construct a decider $D$ that decides PCP for a unary alphabet:
\\
$D$ = ``On input a collection of dominos:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
\item[1.]If any domino has the same number of 1s on the top and bottom, $accept$.
\item[2.]If all dominos have more 1s on the top than the bottom, or more 1s on the bottom than the top, $reject$.
\item[3.]Let $d_1$ be one domino with $c_1$ more 1s on the top than the bottom, and $d_2$ be another domino with $c_2$ more 1s on the bottom than the top.
\item[4.]Choose $c_2$ of the $d_1$ domino, and $c_1$ of the $d_2$ domino.
\end{enumerate}
Step 4 guarantees a match. Let $d_1$ have $t_1$ 1s on the top, and $t_1 - c_1$ 1s on the bottom. Let $d_2$ have $t_2$ 1s on the top and $t_2 + c_2$. Choosing $c_2$ of the $d_1$ domino and $c_1$ of the $d_2$ domino yields $c_2 \times t_1 + c_1 \times t_2$ 1s on the top, and $c_2 \times (t_1 - c_1) + c_1 \times (t_2 + c_2) = c_2 \times t_1 + c_1 \times t_2$ 1s on the bottom, which is a match.
