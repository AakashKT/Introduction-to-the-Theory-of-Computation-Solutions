\item[1.29]Use the pumping lemma to show that the following languages are not regular.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.]\textbf{Solution:} Answered in the text.
\item[b.]\textbf{Solution:} $A_2$ = \{$www$ $|$ $w \in \{a, b\}^*$\}. Suppose that $A_2$ were regular, and let $p$ be the constant for $A_2$ as given by the pumping lemma. Then, let $s = a^{p}ba^{p}ba^{p}b \in A_2$. Therefore, we can decompose $s$ as $xyz$, where $|xy| \le p, |y| > 0$, and $xy^iz \in A_2$ for $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. Since $|xy| \le p$, $x, y$ consist entirely of $a$'s; therefore, we can write $x = a^c$, $y = a^d$, and $z = a^{p-c-d}ba^{p}ba^{p}b$, where $c \ge 0, d > 0, p-c-d \ge 0$. For the third condition, choose $i = 2$: $w = xy^{2}z = a^{c}a^{2d}a^{p-c-d}ba^{p}ba^{p}b = a^{p+d}ba^{p}ba^{p}b$. Since $d > 0$, $w \notin A_2$: therefore, we have a contradiction, and $A_2$ is not regular.

%		1.40		%
\item[1.40]Recall that string $x$ is a \textbf{prefix} of string $y$ if a string $z$ exists where $xz = y$, and that $x$ is a \textbf{proper prefix} of $y$ if in addition $x \ne y$. In each of the following parts, we define an operation on a language $A$. Show that the class of regular languages is closed under that operation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.]\textbf{Solution:} Answered in the text.
\end{enumerate}

%		1.42		%
\item[1.42]For languages $A$ and $B$, let the \emph{\textbf{shuffle}} of $A$ and $B$ be the language \{$w$ $|$ $w=a_1b_1...a_kb_k$, where $a_1...a_k \in A$ and $b_1...b_k \in B$, each $a_i,b_i \in \Sigma^*$\}. Show that the class of regular languages is closed under shuffle.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Let $D_A = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_A, F_A$ and $D_B = (Q_B, \Sigma, \delta_B, q_B, F_B$ be the DFAs recognize $A$ and $B$, respectively. We will design a DFA $D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ such that it recognizes the shuffle of $A$ and $B$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q = Q_A \times Q_B \times \{A, B\}$.
\item $q_0 = (q_A, q_B, A)$.
\item $F = F_A \times F_B \times \{A\}$.
\item For $\delta$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\delta((x, y, A), a) = (\delta_A(x, a), y, B)$.
\item $\delta((x, y, B), b) = (x, \delta_B(y, b), A)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[1.44]Let $B$ and $C$ be languages over $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$. Define
\begin{center}
$B \xleftarrow{1} C$ = \{$w \in B |$ for some $y \in C$, strings $w$ and $y$ contain equal numbers of 1s\}. 
\end{center}
Show that the class of regular languages is closed under the $\xleftarrow{1}$ operation.

%		1.52		%
\item[1.52]\textbf{Myhill-Nerode theorem}. Refer to Problem 1.51. Let $L$ be a language and let $X$ be a set of strings. Say that $X$ is \textbf{\emph{pairwise distinguishable by L}} if every two distinct strings in $X$ are distinguishable by $L$. Define the \textbf{\emph{index of L}} to be the maximum number of elements in any set that is pairwise distinguishable by $L$. The index of $L$ may be finite or infinite.

%		1.53		%
\item[1.53]Let $\Sigma$ = \{0, 1, +, =\} and $ADD$ = \{ $x = y + z$ $|$ $x, y, z$ are binary integers, and $x$ is the sum of $y$ and $z$\}. Show that $ADD$ is not regular.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Assume that $ADD$ is regular. Therefore, there exists a pumping length $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that the three conditions of the Pumping Lemma are satisfied. Choose $w$ as $1^p=0^p+1^p$. Clearly, $w \in ADD$. By the conditions of the Pumping Lemma, we can partition $w = xyz$ such that $|xy| \le p, |y| > 0$, and $xy^iz \in ADD$ for $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$.
\\
By the first and second conditions of the Pumping Lemma, $x$ and $y$ consist entirely of 1s, i.e. $x = 1^a, y = 1^b, z = 1^{p-a-b}=0^p+1^p$ for $a \ge 0, b > 0$.
\\
By the third condition, $xy^iz \in ADD$ for $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. Choose $i=2$: $xy^2z = 1^a1^{2b}1^{p-a-b}=0^p+1^p$ = $1^{p+b}=0^p+1^p$. However, this string is not in $ADD$, because this implies $p+b = p$, but $b > 0$, a contradiction. Therefore, $ADD$ is not regular.

%		1.55		%
\item[1.55]The pumping lemma says that every regular language has a pumping length $p$, such that every string in the language can be pumped if it has length $p$ or more. If $p$ is a pumping length for language $A$, so is any length $p' \ge p$. The minimum pumping length for $A$ is the smallest $p$ that is a pumping length for $A$. For example, if $A = 01^*$, the minimum pumping length is 2. The reason is that the string $s = 0$ is in $A$ and has length 1 yet $s$ cannot be pumped; but any string in $A$ of length 2 or more contains a 1 and hence can be pumped by dividing it so that $x = 0, y = 1$, and $z$ is the rest. For each of the following languages, give the minimum pumping length and justify your answer.

%		1.58		%
\item[1.58]If $A$ is any language, let $A_{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3}}$ be the set of all strings in $A$ with their middle thirds removed so that
\begin{center}
$A_{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3}} = \{xz |$ for some $y$, $|x| = |y| = |z|$ and $xyz \in A$\}.
\end{center}
Show that if $A$ is regular, then $A_{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3}}$ is not necessarily regular.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Let $A = \{0^*\#1^*\}$, which is regular. Therefore, $A_{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3}} \cap \{0^*1^*\} = \{0^n1^n | n \ge 0\}$ is also regular since regular languages are closed under intersection, and $\{0^*1^*\}$ is a regular language. However, the resulting language is not regular, so therefore $A_{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3}}$ is not necessarily regular when $A$ is.

%		1.70		%
\item[1.70]We define the \textbf{\emph{avoids}} operation for languages $A$ and $B$ to be
\begin{center}
$A$ \emph{avoids} $B$ = \{$w$ $|$ $w \in A$ and $w$ doesn't contain any string in $B$ as a substring\}.
\end{center}
Prove that the class of regular languages is closed under the \emph{avoids} operation.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} The idea is to find a regular language that has strings in $B$ as a substring, and remove from $A$ this language. Therefore, define $L_{substr} = \Sigma^*B\Sigma^*$. Clearly, $L_{substr}$ is regular because it is the concatenation of 2 regular languages. Since regular languages are closed under complement and intersection, then $A \setminus L_{substr} = A \cap \overline{L_{substr}}$ is also regular. But these are precisely the strings that are in $A$ that are not in $L_{substr}$, which is what we want.
