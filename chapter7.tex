\subsection*{7.20} We generally believe that \emph{PATH} is not NP-complete. Explain the reason behind this belief. Show that proving \emph{PATH} is not NP-complete would prove P $\ne$ NP.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} We can prove the converse: if P = NP, then \emph{PATH} is NP-complete. We will do two things (in assuming P = NP): show that \emph{PATH} is NP-hard, and because \emph{PATH} $\in$ NP, \emph{PATH} is NP-complete. We will do this by showing $SAT \le_p PATH$.

\par Since P = NP, there is a decider $S$ for $SAT$ that runs in time $O(n^k)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. We construct a TM $T$ that computes the reduction:
\\ \\
$T$ = ``On input \angles{\phi} where $\phi$ is a $SAT$ formula:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]Run $S$ on input \angles{\phi}. If $S$ accepts \angles{\phi}, the construct a graph $G = (V, E)$ such that $s, t \in V, (s, t) \in E$.
\item[2.]If $S$ rejects \angles{\phi}, construct a graph $G = (V, E)$ such that $V = \{s, t\}, E = \emptyset$.
\item[3.]Output \angles{G, s, t}."
\end{enumerate}
Since this reduction takes polynomial time, then P = NP implies \emph{PATH} is NP-complete.
